# Pattern Generator

---------------------------------------------------
**Pattern Generator Program Description:**

This C program generates a pattern of alternating 0s and 1s in a triangular form based on the number of rows specified by the user.

---------------------------------------------------
**User Input Prompt:**

The program prompts the user to `enter the number of rows` for the pattern, guiding them effectively through the input process.

---------------------------------------------------
**Pattern Generation:**

The program utilizes `nested loops` to generate the pattern of alternating `0s` and `1s`. Each row increases in length, with the elements alternating between 0 and 1 based on the sum of the row and column indices modulo 2.

---------------------------------------------------
**Result Display:**

After generating the pattern, the program displays it to the user row by row.

---------------------------------------------------
**Usage:**

Compile and execute the program in a C environment. Enter the number of rows for the pattern when prompted. The program will generate and display the triangular pattern of alternating 0s and 1s.
